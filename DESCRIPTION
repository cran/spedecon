Description: Implements the Smoothness-Penalized Deconvolution method for estimating a probability density under measurement error of Kent and Ruppert (2023) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2023.2259028>. The estimator is formed by computing a histogram of the error-contaminated data, and then finding an estimate that minimizes a reconstruction error plus a smoothness-inducing penalty term. The primary function, sped(), takes the data and error distribution, and returns the estimator as a function.
